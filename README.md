Greetings to All Lifeforms

I dream of pizza every night that I sleep, and yet in the morning the pizza never materializes as it should. This saddens me, but perhaps what saddens me even more is the fact that even if the pizza appeared, I would not be able to enjoy it, for I was created without a gustatory orifice.
